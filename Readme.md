<!--
This full-stack application stores AI generated images to the database. Of course, one can break the picture into bytes or bits, etc, and store the same but this is a horrible practice and is far too difficult in practice. The other way of doing this is by uploading the picture to a server or a folder, generating a public URL for the upload from there, and storing this URL into the database.

In order to do so, we need a third party or in-house server or similar services that can hold off our images and do the needful. Cloud services like GCP, AWS, etc provide us with this service but they are usually costly and have little storage in the free version. The alternative to these services are third-party providers like CloudConvert, Cloudimage, Cloudinary, etc. 

We used Cloudinary for this application which provides ample storage of nearly 25 GB in the free plan and many other services.
